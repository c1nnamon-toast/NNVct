To have a great knowledge of the stuff before the start
    Most common NN types (in order to analyze the current state & create my own solution)
    Basic picturing of the whole concept 
        !Point out that I am not making a sandbox!
    How to provide the best user experience 

What is the current state of NNVs in the world?
    Overall lack of NNVs 
    Unavailability of existing NNVs 
        If they are free they are not open
    Popular solutions and their cons (NN-SVG, Netron, TF sandbox, https://math.mit.edu/ennui/)
        Cover only open-source options, only a few words about 

With the knowledge gained
    Better understanding of the project as a whole

In search of a good solution
    In search of a good visulizing tool 
        Unsutable tools (mostly which specifically made for NN visulization)
        Graph visulizing tools 
            Lack of flexibility (networkx)
            Suitable solutions ()

    In search of library to handle backend of the framework (Flask, node.js, React, TS, raw JS)
    So it could hande:
        Massive NNs (point to the definition of the DNN)
        3 abstract repsentations ()
    Further optimisation (numpy vectorisation)

    and it will have enough functionality to show:
        Interactable edges with opacities, size control, color control and placement controll  
        Interactable nodes, also with colors and opacities, size control, and placement controll 
        Possible to
